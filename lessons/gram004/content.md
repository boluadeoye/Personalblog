## The Workhorse of Punctuation
The comma is the most frequently used (and misused) punctuation mark in English. While it has many jobs, mastering its four primary functions will resolve the vast majority of your comma-related questions.

## 1. Commas in a Series
Use commas to separate three or more words, phrases, or clauses in a series.
- *Example:* I need to buy eggs, milk, and bread.
- *Note:* The final comma before the 'and' is called the Oxford comma. While styles vary, using it is recommended for clarity.

## 2. Comma After an Introductory Element
Use a comma to separate an introductory phrase or clause from the main part of the sentence.
- *Example:* After the long and difficult meeting, we all went for lunch.
- *Example:* If you are not sure, check the manual.

## 3. Comma to Separate Independent Clauses
Use a comma *before* a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so - FANBOYS) when it joins two independent clauses (complete sentences).
- *Example:* The sun was setting, but the team continued to work.

## 4. Comma to Set Off Nonessential Information
Use a pair of commas to set off clauses, phrases, and words that are not essential to the meaning of the sentence.
- *Example:* My brother, who lives in Lagos, is a doctor.
- *Explanation:* The phrase "who lives in Lagos" is extra information. The core sentence, "My brother is a doctor," still makes sense without it.
