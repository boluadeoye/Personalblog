## Stories That Cross Borders
World literature is the study of the world's literary masterpieces, moving beyond the traditional canon of Western Europe and North America. It opens a window into different cultures, belief systems, and human experiences, revealing both what makes us different and what we all share.

## Ancient Foundations
The tradition of storytelling is universal. Long before the novels we know today, cultures around the world were creating epic poems, myths, and legends that explored the fundamental questions of life.
- **The Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamia, c. 2100 BC):** One of the earliest surviving works of literature, this epic poem explores themes of friendship, mortality, and the search for meaning.
- **The Ramayana (India, c. 700 BC):** A foundational Hindu epic that tells the story of Prince Rama's quest to rescue his wife Sita, exploring themes of duty (dharma) and righteousness.

## Why Study World Literature?
Studying world literature does more than just expand your reading list. It cultivates empathy by allowing you to step into the shoes of people from vastly different backgrounds. It challenges your own assumptions and reveals that the themes that matter most—love, loss, family, conflict, and justice—are truly universal. It helps us understand that while our stories may be different, our core humanity is the same.
