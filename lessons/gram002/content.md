## The Role of the Pronoun
Pronouns are the efficient stand-ins of the English language. They take the place of nouns to avoid repetition and make our sentences flow more smoothly. Consider this sentence: "John said John would be late because John's car broke down." It's clumsy. Using pronouns, it becomes: "John said **he** would be late because **his** car broke down." This lesson covers the essential rules for using them correctly.

## Subject vs. Object Pronouns
The most common point of confusion is whether to use a subject pronoun or an object pronoun. The rule is simple:
- **Subject Pronouns** perform the action of the verb. They are **I, you, he, she, it, we, they.**
  - *Example:* **She** and **I** went to the store. (She and I are the ones who 'went').
- **Object Pronouns** receive the action of the verb. They are **me, you, him, her, it, us, them.**
  - *Example:* The teacher gave the assignment to **him** and **me**. (Him and me are the ones receiving the assignment).

A simple trick is to remove the other person from the sentence to see what sounds right. You wouldn't say "Me went to the store," so you know to use "She and I."

## Avoiding Ambiguity
A pronoun is only useful if it's perfectly clear which noun it is replacing. This noun is called the **antecedent**. When a pronoun could refer to more than one antecedent, it creates ambiguity.
- **Ambiguous:** The manager told the employee that **he** would receive a bonus. (Who is receiving the bonus? The manager or the employee?)
- **Clear:** The manager told the employee, "You will receive a bonus."
- **Clear:** The manager, who would receive a bonus, told the employee the news.

Always double-check that your pronouns have a single, clear noun they are referring to.
