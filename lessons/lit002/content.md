## The World as a Stage
Drama is a unique form of literature because it is written not just to be read, but to be performed. Understanding the specific conventions of theater is key to appreciating a play's full impact.

## Dialogue, Monologue, and Soliloquy
- **Dialogue:** The conversation between two or more characters. It is the engine that drives the plot forward.
- **Monologue:** A long speech by one character delivered to other characters on stage. It is often used to persuade, explain, or command.
- **Soliloquy:** A long speech where a character, usually alone on stage, speaks their private thoughts aloud. It gives the audience a direct window into their mind and motivations.

## Stage Directions: The Unspoken Text
The words in parentheses or italics are the **stage directions**. They are instructions from the playwright to the actors and director. They might describe a character's tone of voice, a physical action, or the appearance of the set. While not spoken aloud, they are crucial for understanding the subtext and intended atmosphere of a scene.
- *Example:* [She slams the door, her voice trembling with rage.]

## Dramatic Irony
One of drama's most powerful tools is **dramatic irony**. This occurs when the audience or another character knows a crucial piece of information that one of the main characters does not. This creates tension, suspense, and sometimes humor, as the audience waits for the character to discover the truth.
