## Through Whose Eyes?
Point of view (POV) is the perspective from which a story is told. It is one of the most fundamental choices an author makes, as it controls how much information the reader receives and shapes their emotional connection to the characters and events.

## First-Person POV
In this mode, the narrator is a character within the story, telling it from their own perspective using "I," "me," and "my."
- **Advantages:** Creates a strong sense of intimacy and immediacy. The reader feels a direct connection to the narrator.
- **Limitations:** The reader only knows what the narrator knows and only sees what the narrator sees. The narrator can be biased or even unreliable.
- *Example:* "It was a cold night. **I** pulled **my** collar up and hurried down the street."

## Second-Person POV
This is the rarest point of view, addressing the reader directly as "you." It's often used in choose-your-own-adventure stories or for specific stylistic effects.
- **Effect:** It can be very immersive, making the reader a participant in the story.
- *Example:* "**You** walk down the dark hallway. **You** hear a noise behind **you**."

## Third-Person POV
The narrator is outside the story and refers to characters by name or by "he," "she," and "they." There are two main types:
- **Third-Person Limited:** The narrator sticks closely to the perspective of one character (usually the protagonist). The reader knows the thoughts and feelings of this one character but not others.
- **Third-Person Omniscient:** The narrator is "all-knowing." They can dip into the thoughts and feelings of any character at any time and can provide information that no single character might know. This provides a broader, more panoramic view of the story.
