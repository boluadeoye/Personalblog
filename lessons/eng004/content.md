## Making Characters Sound Real
Dialogue is one of the most powerful tools in a writer's toolkit. It breaks up long passages of prose, reveals character, advances the plot, and provides exposition in a natural way. The key to effective dialogue is making it sound authentic without simply transcribing real-life speech.

## Dialogue Should Have a Purpose
Every line of dialogue should be doing a job. If it isn't revealing character or moving the story forward, it's likely unnecessary. Avoid small talk unless it's specifically being used to create tension or show that a character is avoiding a topic.
- **Weak:** "Hello." "Hi." "Nice weather today." "Yes, it is."
- **Stronger:** "The weather is holding up." "For now," she said, glancing at the dark clouds gathering on the horizon. (Creates foreshadowing).

## Revealing Character
What a character says, and how they say it, is a primary method of characterization.
- Does a character use simple words or complex vocabulary?
- Do they speak in long, flowing sentences or short, clipped phrases?
- Do they interrupt others or wait their turn?
The answers to these questions reveal their education, personality, and emotional state.

## Formatting and Punctuation
- A new paragraph should start every time the speaker changes.
- All punctuation (commas, periods, question marks) goes *inside* the quotation marks.
- Use dialogue tags (like "he said" or "she whispered") to keep the speaker clear, but don't overuse them. Sometimes, the context makes the speaker obvious.
