## The Flavor of Language
Idioms and phrasal verbs are essential components of natural, fluent English. While grammatically simple sentences can convey a message, these expressions add color, nuance, and authenticity, making your writing sound less like a textbook and more like a real conversation. Mastering them is a hallmark of an advanced speaker and writer.

## What is an Idiom?
An idiom is a phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the literal definition of its individual words. It's a form of figurative language that is culturally specific and has a meaning established by common usage.

> **Example:** To "bite the bullet" doesn't involve teeth or ammunition; it means to face a difficult or unpleasant situation with courage.
> **Example:** If something costs "an arm and a leg," it is very expensive.

Because their meaning is not literal, idioms must be memorized. The key to using them correctly is to understand the context in which they are appropriate. They are often informal and should be used sparingly in highly formal academic or business writing.

## What is a Phrasal Verb?
A phrasal verb is a combination of a main verb and a particle (a preposition or adverb) that creates a new, distinct meaning. This new meaning is often, but not always, idiomatic.

> **Verb:** *look* (to direct one's gaze)
> **Phrasal Verb:** *look after* (to take care of)

Phrasal verbs are incredibly common in everyday English. The particle completely changes the verb's action:
-   **break down:** (stop functioning) - "My car **broke down**."
-   **break up:** (end a relationship) - "They decided to **break up**."
-   **run into:** (meet unexpectedly) - "I **ran into** my old teacher at the market."
-   **run out of:** (exhaust the supply of something) - "We **ran out of** milk."

The best way to master both idioms and phrasal verbs is through exposure: pay close attention to them in books, movies, and conversations to understand their natural context and usage.

## Key Takeaways
-   **Idioms:** Phrases where the meaning is figurative, not literal (e.g., "spill the beans" means to reveal a secret).
-   **Phrasal Verbs:** A verb + particle combination that creates a new meaning (e.g., "put off" means to postpone).
-   **Context is Crucial:** Both are often informal and their correct usage is learned through exposure to the language.
-   **Function:** These expressions make writing and speech sound more natural and fluent.
