## The Polish of a Professional
Even the most experienced writers can fall into common grammatical traps. These small errors can undermine credibility and distract from an otherwise powerful message. Learning to identify and eliminate these mistakes is the final polish that separates professional writing from amateur work. This lesson covers four of the most frequent and critical errors to watch out for.

## 1. Modifier Mishaps
A modifier is a word or phrase that describes another word in the sentence. For clarity, it must be placed as close as possible to the word it is modifying. When it's not, the meaning can become confusing or unintentionally humorous.

### Misplaced Modifiers
A misplaced modifier occurs when a descriptive phrase is placed in a way that it appears to modify the wrong noun.
> **Incorrect:** *The patient was referred to a psychologist with several emotional problems.*
> **(Analysis):** This sentence structure implies that the *psychologist* has emotional problems.

> **Correct:** *The patient with several emotional problems was referred to a psychologist.*
> **(Analysis):** By moving the modifier "with several emotional problems" next to "the patient," the meaning becomes clear.

### Dangling Modifiers
A dangling modifier is a phrase that describes a noun that is not actually present in the sentence. It is left "dangling" without a subject to modify.
> **Incorrect:** *Running for the bus, my bag fell and scattered its contents.*
> **(Analysis):** This sentence implies that the *bag* was running for the bus. The actual subject (I) is missing.

> **Correct:** *As I was running for the bus, my bag fell and scattered its contents.*
> **(Analysis):** By adding the subject "I," the sentence now makes logical sense.

## 2. Pronoun Problems
Pronouns are useful shortcuts, but they can create confusion if their antecedent (the noun they refer to) isn't perfectly clear.

### Vague Pronoun Reference
This error occurs when a pronoun like "it," "this," "that," or "which" could refer to more than one thing.
> **Incorrect:** *The manager told the employee that **he** would be receiving a bonus.*
> **(Analysis):** Who is 'he'? The manager or the employee? The meaning is ambiguous.

> **Correct (Option 1):** *The manager told the employee, "You will be receiving a bonus."*
> **Correct (Option 2):** *The manager, who would be receiving a bonus, shared the news with the employee.*

### Pronoun Agreement
A pronoun must agree in number with its antecedent. This gets tricky with indefinite pronouns like *everyone, everybody, each, anyone,* which are grammatically singular.
> **Incorrect:** *Everyone on the team must submit **their** report by Friday.*
> **Traditionally Correct:** *Everyone on the team must submit **his or her** report by Friday.*
> **Modern (Widely Accepted) Usage:** In modern English, using the singular "they" as a gender-neutral pronoun is standard practice. Therefore, the first sentence is now considered correct in most contexts. The key is to be consistent.

## 3. Commonly Confused Words (Homophones)
A spell checker won't catch these errors. They are words that sound alike but have different meanings (homophones).
-   **Your / You're:** `Your` is possessive (your book). `You're` is a contraction of "you are" (you're late).
-   **Their / They're / There:** `Their` is possessive (their car). `They're` is a contraction of "they are" (they're happy). `There` refers to a place (over there).
-   **Its / It's:** `Its` is possessive (the dog wagged its tail). `It's` is a contraction of "it is" (it's a sunny day).

## 4. The Dreaded Comma Splice
A comma splice is a common error where two complete sentences (independent clauses) are joined together with only a comma, which is not strong enough for the job.
> **Incorrect:** *The team finished the project, it was a great success.*

There are three easy ways to fix a comma splice:
1.  **Use a Period:** *The team finished the project. It was a great success.*
2.  **Use a Semicolon:** *The team finished the project; it was a great success.*
3.  **Use a Comma and a Conjunction (FANBOYS):** *The team finished the project, and it was a great success.*

## Key Takeaways
-   **Modifiers:** Always place descriptive phrases right next to the noun they are describing.
-   **Pronouns:** Ensure every pronoun refers to a single, clear noun to avoid ambiguity.
-   **Homophones:** Proofread carefully for words that sound the same but are spelled differently.
-   **Comma Splices:** Do not join two complete sentences with only a comma; use a period, semicolon, or a comma with a conjunction.
