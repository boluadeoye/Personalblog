## The Core Rule
<p>At its heart, subject-verb agreement is simple: a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. The challenge often lies in correctly identifying the subject and ignoring other nouns in the sentence.</p>

## Common Pitfalls
<p>Prepositional phrases, which begin with words like 'of', 'in', 'between', or 'on', can be misleading. For example, in the sentence "The <strong>box</strong> of apples <strong>is</strong> on the table," the subject is "box," which is singular. The phrase "of apples" simply describes the box, so the verb must agree with "box," not "apples."</p>
